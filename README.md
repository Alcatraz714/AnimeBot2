A Discord bot that uses the AniList GraphIQL API, coded in Python. 
You can search for anime/manga titles, users, reverse image anime pictures, and more.

Bugs:
* Reverse image search returns an actual anime even without a link

To Do:
- [ ] Making this look good
- [ ] Commands tab
- [ ] 'How to run this locally' guide
- [ ] Check if image link is a .png/.jpg
- [ ] Reorganise error embeds into other functions?
- [ ] Number of Chapters/Volumes should be N/A and not None
- [x] Regret not using GitHub properly
